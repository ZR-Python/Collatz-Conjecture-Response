Does the Collatz sequence eventually reach 1 for all positive integer initial values?
Yes or No

Once a Number does reach 1, this loop happens
collatz(1) = 4 - EVEN
collatz(4) = 2 - EVEN
collatz(2) = 1 - ODD
collatz(1) = 4 - EVEN
I will refer to this loop as the "Classic Loop"

In order for another loop to happen at another positive integer, it would have to follow the pattern of EVEN, EVEN, ODD, EVEN.
Consider this
collatz(17) = 52 - EVEN
collatz(52) = 26 - EVEN
collatz(26) = 13 - ODD
collatz(13) = 40 - EVEN
This does not yield the same infinite loop as before. The first collatz() and the fourth collatz() are different.
If another loop does exist. The first and fourth collatz() would have the same parameter.

Let's examine other EVEN, EVEN, ODD, EVEN groups in the pattern and compare the first and fourth.
collatz(121) = 364 - EVEN
collatz(364) = 182 - EVEN
collatz(182) = 91 - ODD
collatz(91) = 274 - EVEN
This pattern is similar to the classic loop. The ending digit of each number is the same. However, the final number, 274 
is smaller than the first number, 364. These numbers will spiral down to the classic loop.

Here's another EVEN, EVEN, ODD, EVEN group with matching end digits
collatz(241) = 724 - EVEN
collatz(724) = 362 - EVEN
collatz(362) = 181 - ODD
collatz(181) = 544 - EVEN
This pattern's final number, 544 is smaller than the first number, 724. It'll spiral down, and as a matter of fact, the next five calls of
collatz() are all even numbers sending it down very quickly. 544, 272, 136, 68, 34

For a third pattern with matching end digits, I'll start with 361. These patterns with matching end digits seem to appear at 1, 121, 241, 361, ....
every 1 + 120n will yield a pattern with matching end digits.
collatz(361) = 1084
collatz(1084) = 542
collatz(542) = 271
collatz(271) = 814
Once again a loop fails to form. 814, the final number is smaller than the result of the first collatz() call, 1084. This loop is doomed
to spiral down to 1.
