In conclusion, to answer the Collatz Conjecture, my answer is YES. All positive integers will eventually reach 1.

My proof - In order for a number to not reach 1, there would have to be an infinite loop
with a number other than 1.
 A loop does not exist where the final digits of the integers are 1, 4, 2, 1 as is the case with the Classic Loop.
 The collatz function produces more EVEN numbers than it does ODD numbers, thus causing it to naturally regress.
 If you only examine the final digit of any positive integer, the collatz function will yield an even number in 7.5/10 cases.
 A guaranteed even from an odd input, and a 50/50 shot at an even from an even input.

Even when the Collatz Conjecture spikes and reaches high numbers, it's because of a pattern like this:
ODD: 175
EVEN: 526
ODD: 263
EVEN: 790
ODD: 395
EVEN: 1186
ODD: 593
EVEN: 1780
The best shot the Collatz has at growth is through a pattern of ODD, EVEN, ODD, EVEN, ODD, EVEN. It is impossible to get a pattern
 such as ODD, ODD, ODD. An ODD number will always yield a positive results.
These growth spurts cannot extend forever. EVEN numbers aren't guaranteed to produce ODD numbers. They only produce them half of the time.
2 or more EVEN's in a row only stunts the potential growth of the sequence and brings it closer to 1.
 Through examination of the final digit of any given positive integer, I believe it's clear to see that all numbers will lead to 1.
